## Problem
Describe the problem that your project seeks to solve
Certain games that people play get really boring really quick. Then they have to find another game to play and that can be difficult especially when they are into one specific type of game.

## Big Fat Idea
My big fat idea is to make one game that has monthly updates where the game / map changes consistently to drag people in.  

## First Agile Iteration
The game would have different modes like endless, campaign, or a multiplayer battle royale. And there would be DLC's for the endless mode where new maps can be unlocked. They could choose different levels to play on so that it doesnt get boring. For the multiplayer, There could be updates every month or so in which the map is changed and there can be events. There can be a mode where everyone has an armor suit and they have to battle.
